Time to re-vamp this little quiz and make it better and more Vegas style!

The original 20 images and answers will be removed.

In their place, I have added ./carpets/.   
In this folder is 556 new images.  Each image is named with "the answer" and a bit more info. Format:   

[facility]-[type]-[space]   
- Facility is the name of the facility. Example Bellagio, Aria, etc
- Type is where in the facility - casino floor, hotel, lounge, etc
- Space is a subsection of the Type - hallway, lobby, elevator, etc

Example1:  
aria-casino-baccarat.jpg -> [facility] Aria, [type] casino, [space] baccarat area
aria-casino-baccarat.txt -> provides a little more info (Baccarat February 2022)

Example2:  
aria-hotel-aria_resort_tower_hallway.jpg -> [facility] Aria, [type] Hotel, [space] Aria Resort Tower hallway
aria-hotel-aria_resort_tower_hallway.txt -> provides a little more info (Aria—Resort Tower Hallway June 2023)


New Quiz Format:
* User will be given option of 10, 20, 50 questions.
* Difficulty settings:
    - Easy -> [facility] only
    - Hard -> [facility] + [type]]
* Multiple Choice selection based on difficulty settings
* Status bar to show progress of quiz as the user completes each question
* After each answer (right or wrong) display the additional information from the corresponding txt file
* Update the streamlit langing page to provie reference to the sourced github (https://github.com/gitobic/Vegas-Carpet-Quiz)
* Add thanks and attribuition to original photographer of the pictures (https://www.brentmaynard.com/casino-carpet.html) with a link back. 

Nice to Have, not sure how to do it:
* Opt 1: A global high score table - but since we re uaing Streamlit - not sure how to store update the scores
* Opt 2: A personal high score based on browser cookies / fingerprint? 

Note: Should I get permission from Brent Maynard?
